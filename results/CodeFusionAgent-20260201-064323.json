      "feedback": "The agent's answer is a subjective character judgment about Raj, whereas the correct answer provides a specific physiological reason and intent for his action. 'Raj is weird' does not explain *why* he turned his pelvis, failing to address the core of the question. There is a very weak, indirect relation in that the *situation* described in the correct answer might be considered 'weird', but the agent's answer doesn't convey any of the specific reasoning or events."
