      "winner": "pro_debater",
      "reason": "The Pro debater effectively used emotional appeals by highlighting potential catastrophic consequences and framing regulation as responsible stewardship, drawing parallels to other regulated industries. Their arguments were clear, logically structured, and directly relevant to the topic of AI regulation. The Con debater presented a clear and well-reasoned argument, but their emotional appeal was slightly less impactful, and their suggestion to focus on specific applications rather than broad regulation, while logical, could be seen as a more reactive approach compared to the Pro's proactive stance. Both debaters were highly relevant and clear, but the Pro's stronger framing and call to action gave them a slight edge."
