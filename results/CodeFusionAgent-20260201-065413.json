      "similarity_score": 0.0,
      "feedback": "The answers are completely different and contradictory. The correct answer explains that Sheldon brought tea as a gesture of comfort because Leonard was upset (a social convention). The agent's answer claims the tea was about to expire, which is an entirely different motivation focused on practicality/waste avoidance rather than emotional support. These represent fundamentally different reasons for the same action."
